# Route 15

A fun, real-time multiplayer game with players competing as either route breakers or route finders on a 7x7 interactive grid. I originally developed Route 15 as a pen and paper game in further mathematics A-level where it recieved overwhelmingly positive reviews, and have recently decided to implement my knowledge of full-stack developement in order to rediscover the game in the form of a multiplayer web application. I have used Javascript, HTML, CSS and Node.js for backend development, along with Socket.IO for seamless, low-latency updates between players. I hope to evnentually implement a database using MongoDB to save, rank and match players of a similar level. Developement is still in progress as I hope to eventually host the app on an online server and ideally make it available for public use.
